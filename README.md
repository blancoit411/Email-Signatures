# Blackrock Construction Website

## What is it?

A simple yet elegant solution to providing the client with a bloated wordpress CMS solution, rather it employs Netlify CMS and Eleventy to build static content when updates are pushed to this repository.

**This project is based on [Eleventy Netlify Template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/)**

## [Development Site](https://blackrockconstructiondev.netlify.app/) • [Project Planning](https://www.notion.so/Blackrock-Construction-Website-e2666ecf217b4b6ead00b268c22b2138)

## Proposal

### Overview

The project is a complete redesign of the website [blackrockconstructiontx.com](http://blackrockconstructiontx.com/). It will be an informational site where the user will find details about the services Blackrock Construction offers, its equipment for sale, current job opportunities, and contact functionality. The completed website will include a content management system that would allow website administrators to update and add content. Upon completion, the website content should be easily editable yet look modern and functional, matching or exceeding competitors' sites. It will follow Search Engine Optimization principles that will make it easier to find and more appealing.

### Project Description + Process

#### 1. Design

We'll start with a visual redesign of the website. I'll work with Blackrock Construction staff to determine the best visual style and organization for the site. Our primary focus is to improve visual appeal, usability, and generate more leads. The website should be clean, easy to navigate, and simple to use while communicating the heritage and strong values of Blackrock Construction.

The first step will be to construct a visual prototype. The prototype will communicate the general aesthetic and content layout of the website. This stage is our opportunity to address issues in design and layout. Once this is approved, we'll begin full development.

#### 2. Development & Content

Once we have agreed upon the design and structure, I will begin adding content – this is the phase in which I will write the code and collect assets for the website. I'll communicate through a weekly update to ensure that I am delivering everything you're looking for. A developmental version will be accessible for review throughout this process.

**Specific goals:**

##### Home Page

The site will have a home page containing customizable intro information, a sleek design, and engaging imagery.

##### User-Friendly Layout

The redesigned site will have an easy-to-navigate structure so that all information such as services, projects, careers, equipment for sale, and the contact form is readily accessible.

##### Dynamic Content Pages

The site will include several pages with information that will allow for the regular addition of content or frequent updates. Dynamic content is required for pages that display items for sale, team member profiles, or job opportunities.

##### Proposed Structure

This is an idea based on some of the example competitor's websites.

#### 3. Deployment

After the site construction is completed, we will deploy to the internet and then focus on any issues that arise from deployment. This final step includes training resources concerning the content management system. In this phase, we will also finalize the handing off of all resources, source code, and administration rights before the project is deemed complete.

##### Hosting

Although not included in the price of the redesign, we want to present you with two different options, both of these options are not final as the project has not been completed and we haven't shared traffic data. Based upon the current proposal though we can give you a realistic idea of the cost. 

1) We could host the site for you for **$20/month**. In this situation, we will make sure that the site continues working as designed and that if you have any issues or problems we will be able to provide support. Emergency support is included should anything stop working, however, this does not include additions or changes to the final site.

2) We can help you find a third party to host the site. Beyond the initial setup, we wouldn't be able to provide support once the hosting has been handed over.

### Cost Breakdown

##### Design Mockups - $400

Ideate and design a visual representation of the site, it's aesthetic, structure, layout, interactions, and organization.

##### Home Page + Navigation Setup - $750

Core development and design of the website.

##### Additional Pages - $350

Additional pages that contain the content of the website. Each of these pages will be crafted to make sure all the information is communicated clearly, concisely, and in an engaging manner.

##### Content Management System - $750

Required if the customer wants to manage the site content themselves. Requires logins to manage and a fair amount of initial setup.

#### Total - $2250

### Payment Schedule

The schedule for the project uses the following structure.

**At project start** - **50%**

**At project completion** - *Estimated two months from start date* - **50%**

### What now?

This proposal serves as a project guideline so that we both know what is being delivered. It is a living, changeable document until the project begins. If there's anything you want to add or change, let me know, and I'll create a new draft for review.

If everything looks great, let me know and we'll get the agreement together.

This proposal will be valid until Aug 12, 2020.
